# qva
Quick Visualization in Ada

# Purpose
This library provides easy means of multi-platform 2D visualization and input control. It is modelled after
excellent [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) library and uses mostly [SFML bindings](https://github.com/mgrojo/ASFML)
for doing the real work. The project was started after the author's frustration of dealing with the aforementioned
ASFML object-oriented API and Ada type conversions. The Qva seeks not to replace such a huge library like SFML, but 
to capitalize on the supported multimedia features and to expose it with a straightforward and lean API suitable for
quick visualizations/drawing or even games.

# Features

- Shapes, text, image drawing
